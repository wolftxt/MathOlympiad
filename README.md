To start the program double click the run.bat file if you're on windows or run.command if you're on MacOS/Linux.

This is a program that finds all the possible series of numbers that follow these rules:
1. The numbers in the series must add up to 2024.
2. Every number of the series must be a multiple of the sum of all previous numbers. (Except for the 1st number.)
